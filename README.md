## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I first started to learn HTML and CSS fundamentals in Spring of 2021. Since then, I've shifted a large part of my focus to JavaScript and programming concepts. Working on this project was a great interactive refresher for all of the various CSS properties and how they come together to design a single element on the web page. The two areas that I feel I grew the most in my understanding was in custom properties and alignment with flex and grid.

### Continued development

Areas that I want to continue focusing on is choosing to correct semantic HTML element tags and the positioning of components on a page. I'm not to sure if I will be required to do a lot of extensive design in my future work, but I do believe the basics of colors, typography, and positioning will be important for me.

I think I can work out how to position box-y elements using either flex or grid correctly. However, focusing on this area will allow me to do it much faster -- I imagine 2x - 3x faster than I currently do.
Also, paying attention to how custom properties are used will helpful in understanding how to create a "theme". Especially when these design systems are used in Bootstrap and Tailwind.css as custom extensions.

### Useful resources

- ["Taking on a Frontend Mentor challenge | Responsive Product Preview Card Component" by Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2WL6KkqhLQ) - This video tutorial helped guide me through the process of completing this component. It was useful because I only retained about 70% of the fundamentals of HTML and CSS from my other independent courses completed in early 2021. I don't believe I would have been able to figure out certain design elements, specifically the following:
  - Accurate typography matching the given design: letter-spacing.
  - Following a mobile-first design approach
  - Creating hidden elements on the original price / current price that will be read aloud and thus provide context for visually impaired users.
